Software Lab Project 

This project is created as the deliverable of the course CSE 3120 Software Engineering Laboratory

This app is a simple cardiac reader that keeps records of systolic and diastolic pressure as well as heart rate for a given date and time.
These records can be modified and updated as wished.
Also a record can be deleted using the delete button.

We were teamed by three memebers as suggested, roll-1807108, roll-1807112, roll-1807115

The main app was created and modified by roll 1807112 using the following reference
